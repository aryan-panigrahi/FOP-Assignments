# FOP-Assignments

# 📘 Foundations of Programming (FOP) - Lab Assignments

Welcome to the laboratory repository for the **Foundations of Programming (FOP)** course at **MIT World Peace University**.

This collection houses C programs developed for the **First Year B.Tech (Semester 2)** curriculum. It serves as a comprehensive reference for core programming logic, mathematical algorithms, and data structures.

## 📂 Project Directory

### 🟢 Phase 1: The Fundamentals
* **Assignment 01 - Leap Year Check**
    *Logic:* Checks if a year is divisible by 400 or (divisible by 4 but not 100) to determine if it is a Leap Year.
* **Assignment 02 - Arithmetic Menu**
    *Logic:* A menu-driven program for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division using `switch-case`.
* **Assignment 03 - Multiplication Table**
    *Logic:* Generates the multiplication table for a specific number using looping constructs.

### 🟡 Phase 2: Logic & Algorithms
* **Assignment 04 - Salary Calculator**
    *Logic:* Calculates Gross and Net Salary based on Basic Pay, HRA (10%), TA (5%), and Professional Tax (2%).
* **Assignment 08 - Grading System**
    *Logic:* Accepts marks for 5 courses and computes the Result (Pass/Fail) and Grade (Distinction, First Division, etc.).
* **Assignment 13 - Reverse Digits**
    *Logic:* Prints the digits of a user-inputted number in reverse order using modulo and division operators.

### 🔴 Phase 3: Advanced Math & Matrices
* **Assignment 05 - Matrix Operations**
    *Logic:* Performs Matrix Addition, finds Saddle Points, calculates Inverse (3x3), and checks for Magic Squares.
* **Assignment 09 - Armstrong Number**
    *Logic:* Checks if a 3-digit number is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits (e.g., 371).
* **Assignment 10 - Scientific Calculator**
    *Logic:* Simulates a calculator for basic arithmetic plus special operations like Power (`x^y`) and Factorial (`x!`).
* **Assignment 11 - Math Utilities**
    *Logic:* Computes Square Root, Square, Cube, Factorial, Prime Status, and Prime Factors of a number.
* **Assignment 12 - GCD & SCD**
    *Logic:* Computes the Smallest Common Divisor and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) for two numbers.
