# 📘 Foundations of Programming (FOP) - Lab Assignments

Welcome to the laboratory repository for the **Foundations of Programming (FOP)** course at **MIT World Peace University**.

This collection houses C programs developed for the **First Year B.Tech (Semester 2)** curriculum. It serves as a comprehensive reference for core programming logic, mathematical algorithms, and data structures.

### 🟢 Phase 1: The Fundamentals
* **Assignment 01 - Leap Year Check**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Checks if a year is divisible by 400 or (divisible by 4 but not 100) to determine if it is a Leap Year[cite: 14, 15].
* **Assignment 02 - Arithmetic Menu**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* A menu-driven program for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division using `switch-case`[cite: 33].
* **Assignment 03 - Multiplication Table**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Generates the multiplication table for a specific number using looping constructs[cite: 67].

### 🟡 Phase 2: Logic & Algorithms
* **Assignment 04 - Salary Calculator**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Calculates Gross and Net Salary based on Basic Pay, HRA (10%), TA (5%), and Professional Tax (2%)[cite: 101, 102].
* **Assignment 08 - Grading System**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Accepts marks for 5 courses and computes the Result (Pass/Fail) and Grade (Distinction, First Division, etc.)[cite: 147, 150].
* **Assignment 13 - Reverse Digits**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Prints the digits of a user-inputted number in reverse order using modulo and division operators[cite: 323, 331].

### 🔴 Phase 3: Advanced Math & Matrices
* **Assignment 05 - Matrix Operations**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Performs Matrix Addition, finds Saddle Points, calculates Inverse (3x3), and checks for Magic Squares[cite: 118, 119].
* **Assignment 09 - Armstrong Number**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Checks if a 3-digit number is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits (e.g., 371)[cite: 183].
* **Assignment 10 - Scientific Calculator**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Simulates a calculator for basic arithmetic plus special operations like Power (`x^y`) and Factorial (`x!`)[cite: 209, 210].
* **Assignment 11 - Math Utilities**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Computes Square Root, Square, Cube, Factorial, Prime Status, and Prime Factors of a number[cite: 240, 246].
* **Assignment 12 - GCD & SCD**
    * [cite_start]*Logic:* Computes the Smallest Common Divisor and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) for two numbers[cite: 285, 287].

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

Each assignment is a standalone `.c` file. You can compile them using any standard C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

### 🐧 1️⃣ Linux / macOS (Terminal)
Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing the file.

**Compile:**
```bash
gcc Assignment_05.c -o matrix_app -lm
